It has had its own system of what we might call industrial neofeudalism. 
Instead of the king’s judges enforcing property and contract rights, Chinese entrepreneurs have protection via their fealty to connection groups within the party that others do not wish to cross. Such a system should not work in other Country. Somehow, in China, it works. 

b)
China had been far depressed below that norm by the misgovernment of the Qing, the civil wars of the first half of the twentieth century, the Japanese conquest and the manifold disasters of rule by the paranoid Mao Zedong. Take convergence to that East Asian societal-capability norm, the wisdom of Deng Xiaoping and then Jiang Zemin in applying the standard gaining-manufacturing-technological-capability-through-light-manufacturing-exports development strategy (albeit on an unprecedented scale) and a modicum of good luck, and China seemed understandable. There thus seemed to me to be no secret Chinese institutional or developmental sauce.



1. a)after this stock market crash, China is likely to have another five, maybe ten, years of very healthy growth. 

b)　China may become another corrupt middle-income country.
