    I'm writting this letter to apply for a PhD position. I hope you don’t mind my getting in touch, but I’d like to inquire whether you are currently accepting PhD students. If you are, would you willing to talk to me a bit more by email. I explored your publications pages in detail. 

    For my basic information: My CPGA is 3.55/4 (16%) and has one INFOCOM workshop as first author published on 2019. For more information, you can check my personal page or CV attached. For my domain knowledge in interested areas, I have been doing a lot of paper readings. For industrial practical internship, I have been participated in TiDB/TiKV(a famous open-source distributed database) Community actively to make contribution and complete Talent Challenge Program.
