## Detail of the interview
At the very first begin of my interview, I was inspecting my past experience and thinking my target offer. Because I have done web development in Shenzhen Big Data Institute, so I think it will be helpful if I choose Web Development as my target. As I have expected, I got many interviews from Alibaba, ByteDance and Tencent. 

Talk about the detail of my interview. There are total 4 interviews (3 for professional and final one for HR). All these interviews are taken remotely by camera. At that time, I was doing an exchange program in UC Berkeley and the internship mainly taken place in night. 

For the detial of the interview. Because I'm apply for a intern, so the interview mainly focuses on my past project and my academic paper and my programming skills. For each part of the interview, the interviewer will let me write code to solve a algorithm problem to check my programming ability. In addition, they will also ask me some questions about basic knowledge for university core coursework like Computer Network, Operating System. The interval between each interval is short and I finally pass the whole interview and get the offer in March 3th 2020. 

I wrote a blog in nowcoder to record detail questions:

## Learned lessons
The interview for student is slightly different from social recruitment. For programmer, programming skills and interview experience are the most crucial requirement. For future interview, I will concentrate on programming skills and reflect myself from previous experience.  

## Expected or Not
This internship still taught me a lot, and also taught me the need to lower my expectations and do my job well. When I joined the real workplace, I found that my skills were not enough. I thought that as a front-end developer, I only need to develop my own pages. In actual work, I not only participated in the previous bug fixes, but also worked with colleagues to optimize page performance. This requires a lot of performance analysis at the bottom of the computer. 

As for working hours, I think it is relatively easy. Compared to the programmer 996 that the outside world generally thinks, my off-get off work time is almost concentrated around seven o'clock every day. But this may also be related to my lighter task.

In terms of the newcomer training plan, I think it is still relatively imperfect. My mentor basically only tells me what to do, and I need to find out how to do it myself. This may be a problem for many Internet companies, and they are very important to newcomers. Of course, this also cultivated my ability to solve problems alone.

## The work I have done

After joining the company, I have completed many development tasks. In order to save space, I will not elaborate on them one by one.

The first task is to complete the translation of English comments in the code. The main purpose of this is for potential work handover in the future. Taking this opportunity, I continue to be familiar with the code structure of the project, and also to understand the entire business logic.

The second job is more important and is about security. Tik Tok Live has an anchor signing function, which requires the anchorâ€™s identity information to be uploaded to the server. However, due to historical reasons, the uploaded information is not particularly well protected. I studied the logic and at the same time studied a front-end encryption solution to solve this problem. Finally, the upload information uses the AES256 encryption algorithm, and the obfuscation technology is added to the front end to increase the difficulty of destruction.

The third job is about performance optimization. At that time, the first screen performance of Tik Tok's live broadcast related pages was not very good, and there was a big gap compared with domestic Douyin. So a colleague and I were assigned to improve display performance. We tried many solutions, such as loading fonts asynchronously and deleting redundant resources in the project. In the end, we got better results, and the technical solutions were also shared with other colleagues.

## Your plan of second half of internship
After having experience in Web development, I find my true love in database system development. If I have second half of internship, I want to transfer to infrastructure department and do database kernel development.

## Conclusion
This internship experience in an Internet company is very important to me. It proves that I have the ability to work in a large company, and it also allows me to know how to plan my career path.
